# Create Spotify Playlists

A wrapper for some `spotipy` functions.

## Setup

* You need [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.12.0/)
* You also need to set up a developer key. I followed [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@leighmurray_10641/creating-a-spotify-playlist-with-python-7ff7ee94f612)

## Config File
Save all the deets in a config file names `config.yml` (very creative). It should look like this
```yml
username: 'username - usually a number?'
client_id: 'from the developer dashboard'
client_secret: 'from the developer dashboard'
redirect_uri:  "https://localhost:8080 or whatever"

```
